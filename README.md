# README
Quick RDoc is a Chrome Extension which makes it easier to search the ruby-doc.org
repository.

Example usage: `rdoc (press tab) Array`

After pressing enter you are taken to the Array page in Ruby-Doc.

### Why
After using Ruby-Doc and becoming frustrated with the search built-in to the site
not taking me to specific classes and using it multiple times a day I decided to
write an extension to speed up my lookups on the site.

## TODO
- Create settings page with options:
  - Set default Ruby version
- Allow user to change version in Omnibox (need to come up with syntax)
